## About

Nyx Dynamics is a research initiative at the intersection of quantum biology, spatial computation, and systems neuroscience. We develop theoretical and computational models exploring quantum coherence preservation in biological environments.

**Research Focus:**
- Quantum coherence in biological systems
- Fibonacci-scaled geometric protective mechanisms
- Microtubular resilience under inflammatory stress
- Phase-specific coherence in neuroimmune contexts (HAND, HIV, fever)
