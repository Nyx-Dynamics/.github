## About

Nyx Dynamics is a research consultancy applying computational epidemiology to problems of structural harm. We develop mathematical frameworks demonstrating how systems—biological and institutional—create irreversible damage through timing-dependent integration processes.

**Core Insight:** *What HIV does to your immune system, biased algorithms do to your life opportunities. The mathematics is identical. The irreversibility is identical.*

## Research Areas

### Algorithmic Epidemiology
Modeling algorithmic discrimination as an epidemiological process. Demonstrating that feedback loops in employment, housing, and credit systems follow the same mathematical dynamics as viral infection—with the same irreversibility after integration.

### HIV Prevention Science
Formalizing the biological feasibility constraints on HIV prevention. Demonstrating that prevention failures among marginalized populations reflect structural architecture, not individual behavior.

### Computational Justice
Developing quantitative frameworks for civil rights analysis. Translating biological timing constraints into policy recommendations.

## The Prevention Theorem

<div align="center">

```
R₀(e) = 0 requires intervention BEFORE proviral integration.
Opportunity = 100% requires intervention BEFORE data integration.

After integration: treatment only, prevention impossible.
```

</div>

This principle unifies our work across biological and institutional systems.
